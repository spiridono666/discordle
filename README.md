## Feature Ideas

Pull requests very welcome for any of these!

1. State management of some kind ( Redis, DB, file, etc ) which can be loaded after restart.
2. Store grid of previous commands and results to see every guess made so far.
3. Set a limit of turns for a given game and create a loss condition if a limit is set.
4. Performance profiles & Sharded bot for improved performance
5. Custom images instead of emojis of letters with background colour depending on state.
